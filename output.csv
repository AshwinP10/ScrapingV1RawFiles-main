When such failures occur, a replanning occurs, leveraging both the information retained from the previous iteration and the partial progress of the search completed before the failure to generate a new motion strategy for the reduced team of pursuers."
"Scalable Distributed Planning for Multi-Robot, Multi-Target Tracking",M. Corah; N. Michael,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9636729,NO,"Simulation results—available via open source release—for target tracking with ranging sensors demonstrate that our planners consistently approach the performance of sequential planning (in terms of position uncertainty) given only 2–8 planning steps and for as many as 96 robots with a 24x reduction in the number of sequential steps in planning. Although that analysis is not applicable to target tracking, we prove a similar guarantee, that RSP planning approaches performance guarantees for fully sequential planners, by employing a novel bound which takes advantage of the independence of target motions to quantify effective redundancy between robots’ observations and actions."

In contrast to prior decentralized methods, we propose a novel congestion metric-based replanning that couples local and global planning techniques to efficiently navigate in scenarios with multiple corridors."
Dynamic Pre-Grasp Planning when Tracing a Moving Object Through a Multi-Agent Perspective,M. Bowman; X. Zhang,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9636666,NO,"In the second stage, four different goal point movement strategies are presented to impact the finger goal location in their respective search space to demonstrate the ability to facilitate different needs of the task and requirements of the designer. To fill this gap, we explore the feasibility of using a two-stage optimization method to enable dynamic pre-grasp planning of individual fingers while tracking a moving object to ensure a later successful grasp."
Multi-Objective Task Allocation for Multi-Agent Systems using Hierarchical Cost Function,N. D. Tehrani; A. Krzywosz; I. Cherepinsky; S. Carlson,2022,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9981071,NO,"We consider a variety of constraints including agent capabilities to perform tasks, priorities set by a human supervisor, as well as temporal constraints such as arrival time or coalition formation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm in a battlefield scenario where sub-teams of aerial vehicles are assigned to perform area reconnaissance, target strikes, and intelligence gathering."
